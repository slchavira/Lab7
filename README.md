For this portion of the lab design the solution in the following manner:
1. Create a table using a two-dimensional list that stores a Fahrenheit temperature
and the equivalent Celsius temperature. Use the following range of Fahrenheit
temperatures:
-10 through 100 in increments of 10. Thus the temperatures will be:
-10, 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50â€¦and so on. (LO 1, 2, 3)
2. Display the contents of the list. (LO 2)
3. Similarly create tables/lists for:
a. Miles to kilometers
b. Gallons to liters
c. Pounds to kilograms
d. Inches to centimeters
Starting at 0 through 100 in increments of 10
4. Display the contents of each list.
